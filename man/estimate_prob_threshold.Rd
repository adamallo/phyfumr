\title{Estimate a Multinomial Probability Threshold for Entropy Approximation}
\usage{
estimate_prob_threshold(freqs, n, epsilon = 0.05, sample_size = 1e+06)
}
\arguments{
\item{freqs}{Vector of category probabilities (i.e., frequencies, sums to 1)}

\item{n}{Total count (number of sequences)}

\item{epsilon}{Maximum total probability mass allowed to be skipped. Default
is 0.05.}

\item{sample_size}{Number of compositions to sample for estimating the
threshold. Default is 1M.}
}
\value{
A numeric scalar giving the probability threshold. Compositions with
multinomial probabilities lower than this value can be safely skipped while
keeping total skipped probability mass â‰¤ \code{epsilon}.
}
\description{
This function estimates a probability threshold for skipping low-probability
compositions in multinomial-based entropy calculations. It ensures that the
total probability mass of all skipped compositions is less than or equal to
the specified error tolerance (\code{epsilon}).
